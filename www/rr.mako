                                      Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core values of science, but not always part of daily practice. Registered Reports are a publication format that emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of methodology by conducting the peer review prior to data collection and analysis. Accepted papers then are virtually guaranteed publication in the journal if the authors follow through with the registered methodology.

                                      <p>“Registered Reports eliminates the bias against negative results in publishing because the results are not known at the time of review” said Daniel Simons, Professor at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and co-Editor of Registered Replication Reports at Perspectives on Psychological Science. Chris Chambers, Professor at Cardiff University, section editor at Cortex and Royal Society Open Science, and chair of the Registered Reports Committee supported by the Center for Open Science (COS) adds, “Because the study is accepted in advance, the incentives for authors change from producing the most beautiful story to producing the most accurate one.”</p>

                    <h3>Details</h3>
                    <p>Registered Reports are a form of empirical journal article in which methods and proposed analyses are pre-registered and peer-reviewed prior to research being conducted. High quality protocols are then provisionally accepted for publication before data collection commences. This format of article is designed to reward best practice in adhering to the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method (see Figure 1 below). It eliminates a variety of questionable research practices, including low statistical power, selective reporting of results, and publication bias, while allowing complete flexibility to conduct exploratory (unregistered) analyses and report serendipitous findings. </p>

                    <center><img src="/static/img/pics/hypo_science_workflow.png" alt="hypo deductive workflow" width="550px" class="margin-top-10"></center>
                    <p>Figure 1. The hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method is short-circuited by a range of questionable research practices (red). This example shows the prevalence of such practices in psychological science. Lack of replication impedes the elimination of false discoveries and weakens the evidence base underpinning theory. Low statistical power increases the chances of missing true discoveries and reduces the likelihood that obtained positive effects are real. Exploiting researcher degrees of freedom (p-hacking) manifests in two general forms: collecting data until analyses return statistically significant effects, and selectively reporting analyses that reveal desirable outcomes. HARKing, or hypothesizing after results are known, involves generating a hypothesis from the data and then presenting it as a priori. Publication bias occurs when journals reject manuscripts on the basis that they report negative or undesirable findings. Finally, lack of data sharing prevents detailed meta-analysis and hinders the detection of data fabrication.</p>

                    <h3>Workflow</h3>
                    <p>Authors of Registered Reports initially submit a Stage 1 manuscript that includes an Introduction, Methods, and the results of any pilot experiments that motivate the research proposal. Following assessment of the protocol by editors and reviewers, the manuscript can then be offered in principle acceptance (IPA), which means that the journal virtually guarantees publication if the authors conduct the experiment in accordance with their approved protocol. With IPA in hand, the researchers then implement the experiment. Following data collection, they resubmit a Stage 2 manuscript that includes the Introduction and Methods from the original submission plus the Results and Discussion. The Results section includes the outcome of the pre-registered analyses together with any additional unregistered analyses in a separate section titled “Exploratory Analyses”. Authors must also share their data on a public and freely accessible archive such as the Open Science Framework (OSF) or Figshare and are encouraged to share data analysis scripts. The final article is published only after this process is complete. A published Registered Report will thus appear very similar to a standard research report but will give readers confidence that the hypotheses and main analyses are free of questionable research practices (Figure 1). Detailed author and reviewer guidelines to RRs are available on the Registered Reports resources page. </p>

However	it	is possible	to	perform	protocol	review	even	sooner,	integrating the	review	of	protocols	by journals	and	funders	to	maximise	efficiency	and	impact.	According	to	our	proposed mechanism,	authors	would	submit their	research	proposal	before	they	have	funding. Following	simultaneous	review by	the	both	the	funder and	the	journal,	the	strongest	proposals	would be offered	financial	support by	the	funder	and in-principle	acceptance	for	publication by	the	journal.</p>

First, RRs enjoy continuity of the review process from the initial Stage 1 submission to the final publication, thus ensuring that authors remain true to their registered protocol. This is particularly salient given that only 1 in 3 peer reviewers of clinical research compare authors’ protocols to their final submitted manuscripts. Second, in contrast to RRs, most forms of clinical trial registration (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov) do not peer review study protocols, which provides the opportunity for authors to (even unconsciously) include sufficient “wiggle room” in the methods or proposed analyses to selectively report desirable outcomes or alter a priori hypotheses after results are known. Third, even in the limited cases where journals do review and publish trial protocols (e.g. Lancet Protocol Reviews, BMC Protocols, Trials), none of these formats provides any guarantee that the journal will publish the final outcome. These features of the RR model ensure that it represents a substantial innovation over and above existing systems of clinical trial pre-registration.</p>

The level of detail in the assessment of RRs differs at a scalar level from grants – a funding application typically includes only a general or approximate description of the methods to be employed, whereas a Stage 1 RR includes a step-by-step account of the experimental procedures and analysis plan. Furthermore, since researchers frequently deviate from their funded protocols, which themselves are rarely published, the suitability of successful funding applications as registered protocols is extremely limited. Finally, RRs are intended to provide an option that is suitable for all applicable research, not only studies that are supported by grant funding.</p>

On the contrary we have emphasised that “pre-registration doesn't fit all forms of science, and it isn't a cure-all for scientific publishing.” Furthermore, to suggest that RRs are invalid because they don't solve all problems is to fall prey to the perfect solution fallacy in which a useful partial solution is discarded in favour of a non-existent complete solution. Some scientists have further prompted us to explain which types of research the RR model applies to and which it does not. Ultimately such decisions are for the scientific community to reach as a whole, but we believe that the RR model is appropriate for any area of hypothesis-driven science that suffers from publication bias, p-hacking, HARKing, low statistical power, or a lack of direct replication. If none of these problems exist or the approach taken isn’t hypothesis-driven then the RR model need not apply because nothing is gained by pre-registration.</p>

                                                  <p>Statistical power analysis requires prior estimation of expected effect sizes. Because our research culture emphasizes the need for novelty of both methods and results, it is understandable that researchers may sometimes feel there is no appropriate precedent for their particular choice of methodology. In such cases, however, a plausible effect size can usually be gleaned from related prior work. After all, it is rarely the case that experimental designs are truly unique and exist in complete isolation. Even when the expected effect size is inestimable, the RR model welcomes the inclusion of pilot results in Stage 1 submissions to establish probable effect sizes for subsequent pre-registered experimentation. Where expected effect sizes cannot be estimated and authors have no pilot data, a minimal effect size of theoretical interest can be still used to determine a priori power. Authors can also adopt NHST approaches with corrected peeking or Bayesian methods that specify a prior distribution of possible effect sizes rather than a single point estimate. Interestingly, in informal discussions, some researchers – particularly in neuroimaging – have responded to concerns about power on the grounds that they do not care about the size of an effect, only whether or not an effect is present. Those who advance such positions should beware that if the effect under scrutiny has no lower bound of theoretical importance then the experimental hypothesis (H1) becomes unfalsifiable, regardless of power.  </p>

But underpowered experiments themselves are detrimental to science, dragging entire fields down blind alleys and limiting the potential for reproducibility. We would argue that if a particular research field systematically fails to reach the standards of statistical power set by RRs then this is not “unfair” but rather a deep problem within that field that needs to be addressed. One solution is to combine resources across research teams to increase power, such as the highly successful IMAGEN fMRI consortium. </p>

Authors can thus pre-register the contingencies and rules that underpin future analysis decisions.

                                                    <p><strong>Prereg requirement:</strong> All preregistered analysis plans must be reported. Selective reporting undermines the diagnosticity of reported statistical inferences.
                                                    <p><strong>Possible response to the editor:</strong> The results of these tests are included because they stem from prespecified analyses in order to conduct a confirmatory test. Removing these results because of their non-significance would perpetuate publication bias already present in the literature (<a href="http://orca.cf.ac.uk/59475/" target="_blank">Chambers et al., 2014</a>; <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359" target="_blank">Simmons et al., 2011</a>; <a href="http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/632" target="_blank">Wagenmakers et al., 2012</a>).</p>

                                                    <p><strong>Prereg requirement:</strong> The published article must make clear which analyses were part of the confirmatory design (usually distinguished in the results section with confirmatory and exploratory results sections), and there must be a URL to the preregistration on the OSF.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Possible response to the editor:</strong> The registration was certified prior to the start of data analysis.  This defines analyses that were prespecified and confirmatory versus those which were not prespecified and therefore exploratory. Clarifying this allows readers to see that the hypotheses, analyses, and design that were prespecified have been accurately and fully reported (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3893289" target="_blank">Jaeger & Halliday, 1998</a>; <a  href="http://psr.sagepub.com/content/2/3/196" target="_blank">Kerr, 1998</a>, <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1352120" target="_blank">Thomas & Peterson, 2012</a>).</p>

                                                    This is a legitimate concern. However, one way authors can address this is to design and pre-register such projects several months before they commence. Most grants include a delay between the notice of award and the start date – and this period can be several months. During this intervening period, the grant holder can prepare and submit a Stage 1 RR alongside recruiting staff or students to work on the project. Although the cover letter for RRs requires certification that the study could commence promptly, it is possible to agree a delayed commencement date with journal editors.

                                                  This is one of the most commonly voiced concerns about RRs and would be a legitimate worry if the RR model limited the reporting of study outcomes to pre-registered analyses only. However, we stress that no such constraint applies for RRs launched at any journal. To be clear, the RR model places no restrictions on the reporting of unregistered exploratory analyses – it simply requires that the Results section of the final article distinguishes those analyses that were pre-registered and confirmatory from those that were post hoc and exploratory. Ensuring a clear separation between confirmatory hypothesis testing and exploratory analysis is vital for preserving the evidential value of both forms of enquiry. In contrast to what several critics have suggested, RRs will not hinder the reporting of unexpected or serendipitous findings. On the contrary the RR model will protect such observations from publication bias. Editorial decisions for RRs are made independently of whether the results support the pre-registered hypotheses; therefore Stage 2 manuscripts cannot be rejected because editors or reviewers find the outcomes of hypothesis testing to be surprising, counterintuitive, or unappealing. This stands in contrast to conventional peer review, where editorial decisions are routinely based on the extent to which results conform to prior expectations or desires.

                                                  This need not be the case. It bears reiterating that the RR model does not prevent or hinder exploration – it simply enables readers to distinguish confirmatory hypothesis testing from exploratory analysis. Under the conventional publishing system, scientists are pressured to engage in QRPs in order to present exploration as confirmation (e.g. HARKing). Some researchers may even apply null hypothesis significance testing in situations where it is not appropriate because there is no a priori hypothesis to be tested. Distinguishing confirmation from exploration can only disadvantage scientists who rely on exploratory approaches but, at the same time, feel entitled to present them as confirmatory. We believe this concern reflects a deeper problem that some sciences do not adequately value exploratory, non-hypothesis driven research. Rather than threatening to devalue exploratory research, the RR model is the first step toward liberating it from this framework and increasing its traction. Once the boundaries between confirmation and exploration are made clear we can be free to develop a format of publication that is dedicated solely to reporting exploratory and observational studies. For instance, following the launch of RRs, the journal Cortex is now poised to trial a complementary “Exploratory Reports” format. Rather than seeing RRs as a threat to exploration, scientists would do better to build reforms that highlight the benefits of purely exploratory research.

                                                  Replications are can be expensive and carry little career benefit to authors. Ensuring that a direct replication is convincing often requires a much larger sample than the original study and, once completed, a replication can be difficult to publish because many journals refuse them regardless of outcome. Unless there is an assurance of publication in advance, it can make little strategic sense for scientists to pursue direct replications. In principle acceptance of study protocols provides this assurance and thus offers the strongest possible incentive for scientists to directly replicate previous work. Nearly all of the RR formats launched so far by various journals welcome high-value replication proposals.

The RR model is spreading quickly to many journals, and we believe it is only a matter of time before high-impact outlets follow suit. In the meantime there are several rewards for junior scientists who choose the RR model where it is available. First, because RRs are immune to publication bias they ensure that high quality science is published regardless of the outcome. This means that a PhD student could publish every high quality experiment from their PhD rather than selectively publishing the studies that yielded positive results. Second, a PhD student who submits RRs has the opportunity to gain in-principle acceptance for several papers before even submitting their PhD, which in the stiff competition for post-doctoral jobs may provide an edge over graduates with fewer deliverables to show. Third, because RRs neutralise various questionable research practices, such as p-hacking, HARKing and low statistical power, it is likely that the findings they contain will be more reproducible, on average, than those in comparable unregistered articles. This, in turn, will help build the reputations of the participating scientists as trusted sources of knowledge. The incentive structures in many sciences are evolving quickly in favour of reproducibility.</div>

Low power not only increases the chances of missing genuine effects; it also reduces the likelihood that statistically significant effects are genuine. To address both concerns, RRs that include NHST-based analyses must include a priori power of ≥90% for all tests of the proposed hypotheses. Ensuring high statistical power increases the credibility of all findings, regardless of whether they are clearly positive, clearly negative or inconclusive. It is of course the case that statistical non-significance, regardless of power, can never be taken as direct support for the null hypothesis. However this reflects a fundamental limitation of NHST rather than a shortcoming of the RR model. Authors wishing to estimate the likelihood of any given hypothesis being true, whether H0 or H1, should adopt alternative Bayesian inferential methods as part of their RR submissions. </div>

However, critics who raise this point overlook a major shortcoming of the conventional review process: the fact that manuscripts are often rejected sequentially by multiple journals, passing through many reviewers before finding a home. Under the RR model, at least two of the problems that lead to such systematic rejection, and thus additional load on reviewers, are circumvented. First, editors and reviewers of Stage 1 submissions have the opportunity to help authors correct methodological flaws before they occur by assessing the experimental design prior to data collection. Second, because RRs cannot be rejected based on the perceived importance of the results, the RR model avoids a common reason for conventional rejection: that the results are not considered sufficiently novel or groundbreaking. We believe the overall reviewer workload under the RR model will be similar to conventional publishing. Consider a case where a conventional manuscript is submitted sequentially to four journals, and the first three journals reject it following 3 reviews each. The fourth journal accepts the manuscript after 3 reviews and 3 re-reviews. In total the manuscript will have been seen by up to 12 reviewers and gone through 15 rounds of review. Now consider what might have happened if the study had been submitted prior to data collection as a Stage 1 RR, assessed by 3 reviewers. Even if it passes through three rounds of Stage 1 review plus two rounds of Stage 2 review, the overall reviewer burden (15 rounds) is the same as the conventional model (15 rounds). </div>

When authors submit a Stage 2 manuscript it must be accompanied by a basic laboratory log indicating the range of dates during which data collection took place together with a certification from all authors that no data was collected prior to the date of in-principle acceptance (other than pilot data included in the Stage 1 submission). Time-stamped raw data files generated by the pre-registered study must also be shared publicly, with the time-stamps post-dating in-principle acceptance. Submitting a Stage 1 protocol for a completed study would therefore constitute an act of deliberate misconduct. Beyond these measures, fraudulent pre-registration would backfire for authors because editors are likely to require changes to the proposed experimental procedures following Stage 1 review. Even minor changes to the protocol would of course be impossible if the experiment had already been conducted, and would therefore defeat the purpose of pre-registration. Unless authors were willing to engage in further dishonesty about what their experimental procedures involved, “pre-registering” a completed study would be a highly ineffective publication strategy. It bears mention that no publishing mechanism, least of all the status quo, can protect science against complex and premeditated acts of fraud. By requiring certification and data sharing, the RR model closes an obvious loophole that opportunistic researchers might exploit where doing so didn’t require the commission of outright fraud. But what RRs achieve, above all, is to incentivise adherence to the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method by eliminating the pressure to massage data, reinvent hypotheses, or behave dishonestly in the first place.  </div>

It is also noteworthy that once in-principle acceptance is awarded, the journal cannot reject the final Stage 2 submission because similar work was published elsewhere in the meantime. Therefore, even in the unlikely event of a reviewer rushing to complete a pre-registered design ahead of the authors, such a strategy would confer little career advantage for the perpetrator (especially because the ‘manuscript received’ date in the final published RR refers to the initial Stage 1 submission date and so will predate the ‘manuscript received’ date of any standard submission published by a competitor). Concerns about being scooped do not stop researchers applying for grant funding or presenting ideas at conferences, both of which involve releasing ideas to a larger group of potential competitors than would typically see a Stage 1 RR.</div>

HARKing – “hypothesizing after results are known”: researchers presenting a hypothesis derived from the data as though it was a priori. Low statistical power: researchers failing to ensure sufficient sample size to detect a real effect. Inadequate power not only reduces the chances of detecting genuine effects; it also reduces the chances that observed positive effects are genuine. Lack of direct replication: insufficient numbers of studies seeking to establish reproducibility by repeating the methods of previous experiments as closely as possible. The RR format minimizes these problems and it also requires authors to share their study data upon publication. Therefore, if your journal publishes any articles within any sub-specialty that is exposed to any of these problems then your journal stands to benefit from RRs. Some sub-specialties within particular journals may be more compatible with RRs than others – this is why we recommend RRs as a new option for authors rather than being imposed as a mandatory or universal requirement.  </div>

It is too soon to provide concrete evidence that RRs will not generate fewer citations compared with standard articles; however, there are sound logical reasons for believing that RRs will in fact produce more citations and raise the JIF of outlets that adopt them. First, by requiring data archiving and assuring readers that research outcomes were not produced by p-hacking or HARKing (see above), the credibility of the conclusions in RRs will, on average, be greater than for standard articles. Second, by requiring high statistical power (in some cases more than double the discipline average), the replicability of all outcomes – whether positive or negative – will be among the highest in science. Third, journals are free to exercise full editorial control over the pre-selection of RRs that address the most important and timely scientific questions, that offer the most innovative and intelligent methods to tackle them, and which safeguard feasibility. Therefore, there is little reason for journals to fear the consequences of RRs for JIF. If anything, journals that decide not to offer RRs are likely to fall behind their competitors.  </div>

For this reason, the handling time will exceed that of standard submissions, and because publishers often track the performance of journals via these handling times, it is true that RRs could generate a false signal of poor operational efficiency. There are two solutions to this problem. The first and most obvious fix is to simply disregard the “study time” (i.e. time between in-principle acceptance and the receipt of the Stage 2 manuscript) from the journal statistics. If this is not feasible then the second approach, currently adopted at several journals, is to treat in-principle acceptance as a technical rejection. Authors of provisionally accepted Stage 1 manuscripts are of course informed that this is a rejection in name only, and the subsequent Stage 2 submission is treated as a linked resubmission. This solution is compatible with the existing infrastructure at most journals and avoids the inclusion of the study time in the journal statistics. </div>

                                                <div class="panel-body">This is straightforward. The peer review process for RRs differs in two ways from conventional review, both of which can be dovetailed with existing systems. First, unlike standard submissions, RRs have two distinct stages of review – one before data collection and one afterward. This can be integrated into existing software by simply treating each stage as a new submission, linked by a journal editorial assistant, and by treating in-principle acceptance as a technical “rejection” (see 10F). Second, the review process for RRs at several journals is structured: reviewers are asked to assess the extent to which the manuscript meets a number of fixed criteria. Even if your handling software is unable to implement a structured review mechanism in which reviewers enter text into pre-defined fields, the criteria can be easily incorporated into the reviewer invitation letters. We have found that this works adequately provided the attention of reviewers is drawn specifically to these criteria. Generic templates of reviewer invitation letters and editorial decision letters can be downloaded from our Registered Reports resources page. Once adapted to your specific requirements, the technical staff at your publisher should be able to add them to the system in a matter of days. At Cortex, for example, the necessary amendments to the Elsevier Editorial System were implemented in less then a week by a single member of the publishing staff.  </div>

Early in the life of this new format, authors may be uncertain of requirements, and for the journals that have adopted RRs so far it is not uncommon to receive submissions that require basic amendments before they can be suitable for in-depth review. For instance, the Stage 1 manuscript might not include an adequate statistical power analysis or it may lack sufficient detail in the proposed analyses. Often these oversights can be detected and corrected before seeking in-depth review. Depending on the scope of the journal, editorial boards may also wish to pre-select Stage 1 RRs that propose to address the most important or relevant research questions. At Cortex, these responsibilities are overseen by a team of four associate editors in different sub-specialities together with a section editor who is responsible for overseeing the RR category. These requirements will differ between disciplines; in many sciences a smaller triage team would suffice. </div>
